# transactions
A basic vanilla PHP page showing transactions from a csv.

This script gets the transaction file from the directory. Then it reads the transactions from the sample csv and parses, arranges into rows with fields and outputs
the transactions with custom dollar formatting and date formatting. Each field is then calculated with total income and total expenses and the net total, which is displayed in
the view.

This was a basic script for practice to work in plain PHP.
